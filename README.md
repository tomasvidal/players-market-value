# Soccer Player Market Value Prediction Project

This project showcases data analysis and machine learning skills through the creation of prediction models for soccer player market values.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop prediction models that estimate soccer player market values based on various attributes. The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading:** The project starts by reading data from a CSV file containing player information.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping unnecessary columns.

3. **Data Visualization:** Utilizing libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, the project visualizes insights about player attributes and their relationships with market values.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are selected and engineered to enhance the predictive power of the models.

5. **Machine Learning:** The project implements machine learning models using scikit-learn. Classification models like Random Forest are used to categorize players, and Linear Regression is employed for predicting market values.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy for classification and mean squared error for regression.

7. **Documentation and Modularity:** The code is organized into functions and modules for better readability and maintainability. Comments explain key steps.
